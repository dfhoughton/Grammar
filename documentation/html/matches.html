	<h1>Working with Matches</h1>
	<p>
		Regular expressions make it very easy to find whether a string matches
		a pattern and where. For finding how it matches -- what parts of the
		string match what parts of the pattern -- their facilities are much
		more limited: you can enclose parts of the pattern in parentheses,
		creating matching groups. This is one respect in which
		<code>dfh.grammar.Match</code>
		objects shine: they represent the entire match tree. The problem them
		is how to extract this information from the object. This section
		explores the techniques available.
	</p>
	<span id="toc"></span>
	<h2>Stringification</h2>
	<p>
		The
		<code>dfh.grammar.Match</code>
		object provides a
		<code>toString()</code>
		method that succinctly represents the entire match tree in a human
		readable form. For debugging output and such this may suffice.
	</p>
	<pre>		String[] rules;
		Grammar g;
		Match m;
		rules = new String[] {
				//
				"ROOT = &lt;foo&gt;",//
				"foo = 'f' 'oo'",//
		};
		g = new Grammar(rules);
		m = g.find("foo barquux foofoofoo quuxbar").match();
		<b>System.out.println(m);</b>
	</pre>
	<p>produces</p>
	<pre class="results">("f" "oo": 0, 3 [("f": 0, 1), ("oo": 1, 3)])</pre>
	<p>The entire stringification is enclosed in round brackets.</p>
	<pre class="results">
		<b>(</b>"f" "oo": 0, 3 [("f": 0, 1), ("oo": 1, 3)]<b>)</b>
	</pre>
	<p>The first item inside these parentheses is a label for the rule
		generating the match.</p>
	<pre class="results">(<b>"f" "oo"</b>: 0, 3 [("f": 0, 1), ("oo": 1, 3)])</pre>
	<p>The label is separated from the remainder by a colon.</p>
	<pre class="results">("f" "oo"<b>:</b> 0, 3 [("f": 0, 1), ("oo": 1, 3)])</pre>
	<p>Immediately after the colon is a pair of integers represented
		the start and end offsets of the match.</p>
	<pre class="results">("f" "oo": <b>0, 3</b> [("f": 0, 1), ("oo": 1, 3)])</pre>
	<p>The last item within the parentheses, occurring only in
		non-terminal matches, is a list in square brackets of child matches.</p>
	<pre class="results">("f" "oo": 0, 3 <b>[("f": 0, 1), ("oo": 1, 3)]</b>)</pre>
	<p>As you can see, even a simple match may have a complex
		stringification. If you don't find this Lisp-esque stringification to
		your taste, or you need to do more than admire your matches, read on.</p>
	<h2>Getting the Corresponding Text</h2>
	<p>If you want the string matched, there are two ways to go about
		it.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>use the <code>start()</code> and <code>end()</code> offsets <pre>String matched = s.substring(match.start(), match.end());</pre>
		<li>use the <code>group()</code> method <pre>String matched = match.group();</pre>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Given the simplicity of the latter, why ever use the former? Well, for
		the sake of efficiency,
		<code>group()</code>
		is only available after matching has completed for the entire grammar.
		This means that in conditions and debugging if you call
		<code>group()</code>
		a runtime error will be thrown.
	</p>
	<h2>Walking the Match Tree</h2>
	<p>If you wish to study the structure of the match, if you are
		using a grammar for parsing rather than simple validation or text
		extraction, you have to walk match tree. The match object provides
		numerous methods to facilitate this. Here are the principle ones.</p>
	<h3>match tree walking methods</h3>
	<h4>
		<code>walk(MatchTest)</code>
	</h4>
	<p>
		This generic method allows you walk the match tree, performing some
		action at every node. The
		<code>MatchTest.test(Match)</code>
		method is the action performed. If this method returns
		<code>true</code>
		, no children of the node tested will be walked (If you wish to walk
		the entire tree, simply construct a method that always returns
		<code>false</code>
		). Because of this, a node is necessarily tested before its children.
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>get(String)</code>
	</h4>
	<p>This method walks the match tree rooted at the current node,
		returning a list of nodes having the given label. For example, a node
		matched by</p>
	<pre>foo = [{bar} "baz"]</pre>
	<p>
		will have the labels <i>foo</i>, <i>bar</i>, and <i>"baz"</i>. A match
		can always be retrieved by the
		<code>uid()</code>
		of the rule that generated it, in this case, "baz", but except in the
		case of literals like this it may not be obvious what the appropriate
		<code>uid()</code>
		is, so one should use rule labels or named captures as illustrated
		here.
	</p>
	<p>
		This method in fact delegates to
		<code>get(MatchTest)</code>
		after generating an appropriate match test. You can achieve some
		efficiency in this and the other tree walking methods by constructing
		the appropriate tests once and reusing them.
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>get(MatchTest)</code>
	</h4>
		<p>This method returns a list of all nodes matching the given
			test. Children are returned before parents.</p>
	<h4>
		<code>first(String)</code>
		,
		<code>first(MatchTest)</code>
	</h4>
	<p>
		This method returns the first node under the current node (including
		the current node) that matches the given test or has the given label.
		This method necessarily tests parents before children. Because it
		returns upon the first match and doesn't construct any list, it is
		more efficient than
		<code>get(MatchTest).get(0)</code>
		(which also, given the varying test order, might not return the same
		node).
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>closest(String)</code>
		,
		<code>closest(MatchTest)</code>
	</h4>
	<p>
		This method tests the nodes under the current node. If a node passes
		the test -- having the correct label or satisfying the
		<code>MatchTest</code>
		object -- it is added to the return list and no further tests are
		performed on the passing node's children. So, for example, in the tree
		below, if
		<code>a</code>
		is the root node,
		<code>a.closest("a")</code>
		will return the highlighted nodes.
	</p>
	<pre>
	  a
	 / \
	<b>a</b>   b
	   / \
	  <b>a</b>   <b>a</b>
	  |
	  a
	</pre>
	<h4>
		<code>children()</code>
	</h4>
	<p>
	The children of the match.
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>parent()</code>
	</h4>
	<p>
		The parent node of the match in the match tree.
		<span class="fn">Nodes are not linked to their parents during the
			matching process. This step is performed immediately before a match
			is returned by a <code>find()</code>, <code>lookingAt()</code>, or <code>matches()</code>.
			In the event that a match fails and rightmost matching is on (see
			options in <a href="syntax.html">syntax</a>), the match tree of the
			rightmost node will have its child-to-parent links completed.
		</span>
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>ancestor(String)</code>
		,
		<code>ancestor(MatchTest)</code>
	</h4>
	<p>
		This method is somewhat similar to
		<code>closest</code>
		: it returns the nearest single node to the current node matching the
		test, but
		<em>ascending</em> the match tree rather than descending, moving
		towards the root rather than the leaves.
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>ancestors(String)</code>
		,
		<code>ancestors(MatchTest)</code>
	</h4>
	<p>This method climbs the match tree from the current node returning a
		list of nodes matching the test in the order of their discovery.</p>
	<h4>
		<code>leaves()</code>
	</h4>
	<p>This method returns the leaf nodes under the current node.</p>
	<h3>
		<code>MatchTest</code>
		objects
	</h3>
	<p>
	<code>MatchTest</code> is a simple, one method interface:
	</p>
	<pre>public interface MatchTest {
	boolean test(Match m);
}</pre>
	<p>
		This interface is used by almost all the methods above. Here, for
		example, is the implementation of
		<code>get(String)</code>
	</p>
	<pre>	public List<Match> get(final String rule) {
		return get(new MatchTest() {
			@Override
			public boolean test(Match m) {
				return m.hasLabel(rule);
			}
		});
	}</pre>
	<p>
		You can gain some efficiency by pre-compiling all the
		<code>MatchTests</code>
		you need. The
		<code>dfh.grammar.Match</code>
		test itself provides a number of useful tests precompiled.
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>Match.ALL</code>
	</h4>
	<p>Use this test to obtain a list of all the nodes in the match
		tree.</p>
	<h4>
		<code>Match.ANONYMOUS</code>
	</h4>
	<p>Use this test to obtain a list of all the nodes in the match
		tree that are defined in the course of defining another rule. In</p>
	<pre>ROOT = "a" | "b"</pre>
	,
	<code>&lt;ROOT&gt;</code>
	is named and
	<code>"a"</code>
	and
	<code>"b"</code>
	are anonymous.
	<h4>
		<code>Match.NAMED</code>
	</h4>
	<p>Use this test to obtain a list of all the nodes in the match
		tree that are defined by their own line in the grammar.</p>
	<h4>
		<code>Match.NON_TERMINAL</code>
	</h4>
	<p>Use this test to obtain a list of all the non-leaf nodes in the
		match tree.</p>
	<h4>
		<code>Match.TERMINAL</code>
	</h4>
	<p>Use this test to obtain a list of all the leaf nodes in the
		match tree.</p>
	<h4>
		<code>Match.WIDE</code>
	</h4>
	<p>Use this test to obtain a list of all the nodes in the match
		tree whose matching advanced the matching offset. This will exclude
		things such as assertions, trivially matching regexes, and
		backtracking barriers.</p>
	<h4>
		<code>Match.WIDE_LEAF</code>
	</h4>
	<p>
		This is like the
		<code>WIDE</code>
		test but it only returns leaves.
	</p>
	<h4>
		<code>Match.ZERO_WIDTH</code>
	</h4>
	<p>Use this test to obtain these matches whose matching did not
		advance the match offset at all. These are such things as empty string
		literals, trivially matching regexes, assertions, and backtracking
		barriers.</p>
