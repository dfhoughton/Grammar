	<h1 style="text-align: center">Grammar</h1>
	The
	<code>dfh.grammar</code>
	library is a pattern matching library for Java inspired by the enhanced
	regular expression facilities provided by Perl 5.10+ and Perl 6. The
	basic functionality in the Perl 5.10+ regex engine is
	<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html">awesome</a> in itself,
	but the syntactic sugar provide by
	<a
		href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Regexp%3A%3AGrammars&mode=module">Regexp::Grammar</a>
	adds another order or magnitude of awesomeness, and
	<a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/exe/E05.html">Perl 6</a>
	adds another level beyond that. Java's character class syntax is
	similarly awesome, but Java regular expressions of any size are
	unreadable I wanted me some of that compositional syntax and recursion.
	Being too lazy to find someone else's solution, I decided to write one
	myself. This library, which is still evolving but certainly usable, is
	the product of this labor of obsession.
	<h2>The Basic Idea</h2>
	<div>
		The image above was produced by taking the grammar
		<pre>
&lt;ROOT&gt; = ~&lt;b&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;r&gt;?+ &lt;a&gt; &lt;m&gt;{2} &lt;a&gt; &lt;r&gt; ~&lt;b&gt;

   &lt;a&gt; = "a"
   &lt;b&gt; = / $ | ^ /x
   &lt;g&gt; = /g/i
   &lt;m&gt; = "m"
   &lt;r&gt; = "r"	
	</pre>
		and applying it to the word <i>Grammar</i>. <span class="fn">Specifically,
			I combined the two using the <code>MatchToDot</code> application
			included with the <code>dfh.grammar</code> distribution, passing that
			through <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a> and rescaling
			the image a bit with <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. </span> As
		you can see, a grammar looks a lot like a <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">BNF
			grammar</a>. It consists of a "root" rule and some number of constituent
		rules. When the grammar matches against a character sequence, it's the
		root rule that matches. Constituent rules are invoked as needed by
		other rules. The atomic elements of a grammar are literals or regular
		expressions.<span class="fn">Or arbitrary extensions of the <code>dfh.grammar.Rule</code>,
			as is explained elsewhere.</span>
