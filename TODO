Desired items are preceded by a '.'; completed items, by a '*'; discarded items, by a '-'.

* change parsing rules so that angle brackets are only required to the right of '='
* parameterize describe() so it either alphabetizes of lists rules in order of dependence
- implement regex reversal
* implement tagging
* implement in-line regexes
* implement reversibility of externally defined rules
. keep rules distinct by tags but allow functionally equivalent rules to share offset cache
* change default study value based on match type
* fix external rule renaming bug
* preserve rightmost offset matched to to improve debugging
* allow boolean combinations of conditions
. allow special notation for non-reversible, non-same-rule backreferences
. allow notation to selectively disable studying of certain expressions
. call setGroup() on righmost match in event of failure
. make sure non-terminal matches are using their subcache
