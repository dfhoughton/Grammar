Grammar
=======

This is an experiment to create in Java something like the Grammar facilities
of Perl 6 or the recursive regexes of Perl 5.10+. It will parse by recursive
decent, will produce ASTs, will be genericized to handle arbitrary symbol
sequences, will parse alternates concurrently, and will return multiple ASTs for
ambiguous sequences.

This is idle itch scratching. I aim to make it robust and well-tested but I make no
guarantees. If you want robust, seasoned code, or code distilled from thousands of
hours of academic research, try ANTLR or Parboiled or something such
