Grammar
=======

This is an experiment to create in Java something like the Grammar facilities
of Perl 6 or the recursive regexes of Perl 5.10+. It will parse by recursive
decent, producing ASTs.

This is idle itch scratching. I am writing this because it's more fun than figuring
out how to use someone else's library. Also, I need recursive matching for a current
project, so now's a good time. I aim to make it robust and well-tested but I make no
guarantees. If you want robust, seasoned code, or code distilled from thousands of
hours of academic research, try ANTLR or Parboiled or something such. I confess I read
none of the relevant research nor studied anyone else's algorithms before I started this,
so a good bit of wheel re-invention is likely embodied in this code.

NOTE: THIS CODE DOES NOT YET WORK!!! I've only just begun and much of it remains
unwritten. I'll take this note away when it's working to some degree.
